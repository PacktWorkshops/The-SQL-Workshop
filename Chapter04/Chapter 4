Example 1:

/* How to perform a simple insert into the Department table*/

 DROP TABLE IF EXISTS department;

CREATE TABLE department
  (
     departmentno   INT PRIMARY KEY,
     departmentname VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
     departmentloc  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL

INSERT INTO department ( 
    departmentNo,

) 
VALUES (

'Engg', 
'Texas' 
); 


Example 2:

/* Perform multiple insert statement*/

INSERT INTO department 
            (departartmentno, 
             departmentname, 
             departmentloc)

            ( 60, 
              'Testing', 
              'MN' ); 
              
 Example 3:
 
 /* MSSQL Server - Perform insert along with a default columns */
 
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS department;
CREATE TABLE department
             (
                          departmentno   int IDENTITY(10, 10) PRIMARY KEY,

             ) 

INSERT INTO department
            (departmentname) 
VALUES      ( 'MyDepartment' ); 

 Example 4:
 
 /* MySQL Server - Perform insert along with a default columns */
 
 CREATE TABLE department

     departmentestdate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now() 
  ); 
  
INSERT INTO department
            (departmentname) 
VALUES      ( 'MyDepartment' ); 


Example 5:

--you can add multiple rows into the table, and the default columns will pick their values accordingly. Say, you would like to add two more departments, Administration and IT. 

INSERT INTO department
            (departmentname, 
             departmentloc) 
VALUES      ( 'Administration', 
              DEFAULT ), 
            ( 'IT', 
              DEFAULT ); 
  
 Example 6:
 
 --you can also use a SELECT statement to add multiple records into a table. Here is how: 

INSERT INTO department(departmentName,departmentLoc) 
SELECT departmentName, departmentLoc FROM department; 

SELECT * from department;

Example 7:

--let’s delete the rows where departmentNo is ‘>’ 4. This will delete the two rows where departmentNo is 5 and 6.

DELETE from department where departmentNo>4; 

Example 8:

-- Auto increment scenario

insert into department(departmentname,departmentLoc) values('Sales','LV'); 

--On selecting the rows, we can see that auto_increment column starts at 7.
